# Understanding Serverless

Here we'll take a deep dive into the internals of Serverless and understand what a service is and how functions relate
to a service.

Additionally we look at the Serverless key pieces of each service which are the [`serverless.yaml`](serverless-yaml.md)
and [`serverless.env.yaml`](serverless-env-yaml.md) files.
