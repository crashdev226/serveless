# JAWS: Project Structure

All JAWS apps use the directory structure described in the diagram below.  This scaffolding can be generated by running the `jaws new project` command.

Web, mobile and IoT applications can be built on JAWS, since JAWS is mostly a back-end focused framework.  JAWS comes with a `front` folder, but doesn't do much with it (yet).
