# Invoking a function

Next up we'll invoke the `hello` function from our service (this example function was automatically created when we
initially created our service).

Run `serverless invoke --function hello --stage dev --region us-east-1` to tell Serverless that you want to run the function.

The function get's invoked and you should see a message on your console.

Great! We've just executed our first function from our Serverless service!
