Serverless is the application framework for building web, mobile and IoT applications on serverless, event-driven compute services, like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google CloudFunctions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) and more. 

It's a command line interface that provides scaffolding, automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture. It's also completely extensible via plugins.

The Framework and its related tools are maintained by a dedicated, full-time team. For updates, join our Mailing List. We work on this live in our Gitter Chatroom. Please join us, everyone is welcome :)

Also, [we're hiring](mailto:jobs@serverless.com)!
