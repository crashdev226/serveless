JAWS: The Javascript + AWS Stack
=================================

Scalable, stable, cheap, javascript web application stack, backed by AWS's best services.

New tools come and go, meanwhile Amazon's keep getting better and they keep cutting costs.  This stack is for adults with starter projects they want to grow immensely and economically.  It covers all aspects of a SaaS service, utilizes AWS services that scale automatically (so you don't have to deal with that), and is the best starting point for small teams/solopreneurs making an app and a business.

This boilerplate is current under development...

Starring
=================================

**Javascript:**
- Node.js
- Express.js
- HTML5 Boilerplate â€“ *Insert the javascript front-end framework of the day here.*

**AWS Services:**

- Lambda - *Build worker tasks that you can spawn and scale infinitely.*
- AuroraDB (Coming Soon) - *Traditional Relational data storage at Aurora's incredible speed.*
