Set-Up
=================================

#### AWS Set-Up

* [Create an AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com/,), if you don't have one already
* Create an IAM user

#### Creating New API Routes/Lambda Functions

* Copy and paste the `api/template` folder somewhere in the `api` folder and rename it.
* To require the `lib` into your Lambda functions, we recommend creating an [npm link](https://egghead.io/lessons/node-js-using-npm-link-to-use-node-modules-that-are-in-progress).  Cd into your lib folder, run `npm link`, then cd into your lambda function's folder and run `npm link jaws-lib`.
