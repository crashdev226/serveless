JAWS â€“ The Javascript + AWS Stack
=================================

The scalable, cheap, javascript web application stack, backed by AWS's best services.

New tools come and go, meanwhile Amazon's keep getting better and they keep cutting costs.  This stack is for adults with starter projects they want to grow immensely and economically.  It covers all aspects of a SaaS service, utilizes AWS services that scale automatically (so you don't have to deal with that), and is an attempt to make the best starting point for both an app and a business.

This boilerplate is current under development...

- Node.js
