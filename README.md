The Serverless Framework is the application framework for building web, mobile and IoT applications on serverless, event-driven compute services, like [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Google CloudFunctions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/), [Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) and more.

The Framework is a command line interface that provides scaffolding, automation and best practices for developing and deploying your serverless architecture.

It's also completely extensible via plugins.

This is maintained by a full-time, venture-backed team. For updates, join our [mailing list](http://github.us11.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=b4fad36768cab222f88338995&id=5f8407dded).

For help, join our [gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/serverless/serverless).

Also, [we're hiring](mailto:jobs@serverless.com) :)

## Quick start

Follow these simple steps to install serverless.

Create and deploy your first service in under 5 minutes.

1. `npm install -g serverless@beta # Install Serverless CLI`
2. `mkdir my-first-service && cd my-first-service # Create the project directory`
3. `serverless create --template aws-nodejs # Create an AWS node lamdba function`
4. `serverless deploy # Deploy to live AWS account`
5. `serverless invoke --function hello # run the live API endpoint`

Run `serverless remove` to clean up this function from your account.
